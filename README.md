Archive of anonymous's Mod Jam Prep repo, containing a few new features, one on the artifact, the other on the prototype artifact (the one that explodes).

Artifact Changes: Added Time Vision Mechanic
This mechanic lets you see what buildings looked like before they got destroyed. It only works for the Prisoner's House in the Starlit Cove. The player needs to press InputLibrary.toolOptionY, which I forget what button that is. There is no tooltip because anon didn't figure those out. It was an idea of pikpik's we almost used for Jam 5.

Prototype Changes: Water Leap Mechanic
A long time ago, Bird, anon, and several others were discussing a grand mod idea involving the use of the prototype artifact (we have a lot of mod ideas but we never actually make them lol). This mod was on anon's mind for a while so they decided to code one of the features themselves to prep for the jam. When the player's feet touches water, the prototype explodes again and launches the player upward. It's a bit janky, but it works.

Debug Prototype Hotkeys:
If you hit both the conceal and focus buttons, you will be warped to the Hidden Gorge Dream Campfire with the prototype in your hand. This little tool helped make developing the prototype mechanics a hell of a lot easier.

**NOTE: This mod uses The Stranger They Are's** ***strangerbundle*** **AssetBundle. Since it's so big, you will need to grab it by installing TSTA through the mod manager or by downloading the GitHub release, and** ***adding strangerbundle and its manifest yourself.***
